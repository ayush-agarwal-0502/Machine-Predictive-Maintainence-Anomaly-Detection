    "In the previous lab, we used LSTMs to predict hard drive failures. While timeseries prediction is a very well-studied approach in predictive maintenance, in this section we focus on a different deep learning technique, which is called __anomaly detection__. In a nutshell, considering the fact that only a small portion of the hard drives are defective in our use case, we can treat those as anomalies. For example, out of three million samples we dealt with in our training set within the previous lab, only 256 samples were defective. Those are \"anomalies\" among the big pool of well-functioning hard drives. Now, if we could have a model capable of learning what a proper functioning hard drive looks like, it could detect hard drives with a different behavior pattern.\n",

    "In this lab, we will leverage the same Backblaze Hard Drive SMART data to train an Autoencoder model that will detect anomaly activity.  We'll leverage the time series sequences that we created in the previous step to train an Autoencoder Model to identify when there are significant variances from expected sensor data.  These variances can be used to alert support teams that there are potential issues with the system.\n",

    "You'll see that autoencoders (AEs) are relatively easy to use, but let's first walk through the basics of using autoencoders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use unsupervised learning algorithms like a deep autoencoder network to perform anomaly detection. A deep autoencoder takes an input X and attempts to map it back to itself; in essence, the autoencoder is trying to learn the identity function of the input data. Since learning the identity function is pretty trivial, we force the hidden layers of our autoencoder to be of lower dimensionality than the previous layer. This constraint forces the autoencoder to learn patterns in the data, and really learn efficient representations. \n",

    "\n",
    "To train this type of neural network, we can calculate the difference between the input and the output and use that loss, typically called a reconstruction loss, as our loss function for training our model. The idea is that our autoencoder is essentially learning the data generating distribution for a unique dataset, and when we feed data generated from a different distribution into our autoencoder, our autoencoder will do a very poor job of reconstructing the input from the second source and our reconstruction error will be high; this indicates that our input is anomalous instead of just an extreme value.\n",

    "Autoencoders are a subset of neural network architectures where the output dimension is the same as the input dimension. Autoencoders have two networks, an encoder and a decoder.  The encoder encodes its input data into a smaller dimensional space, called the latent space.  The decoder network tries to reconstruct the original data from the latent encoding. Typically, the encoder and decoder are symmetric, and the latent space is a bottleneck. The autoencoder has to learn essential characteristics of the data to be able to do a high-quality reconstruction of the data during decode.\n",

One built with LSTM layers and one built on top of 1D-Convolution.  You'll have the opportunity to test both.  Additionally, you'll see that we leverage Dropout layers as a way to control overfitting by randomly omitting subsets of features at each iteration of a training procedure. To begin, let’s import some libraries that we are going to use throughout this lab."

    "## ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve plots the False Positive rate along the horizontal axis and the True Positive rate along the vertical axis. False Positive rate and True Positive rate will change based on the various threshold values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold is high at the y-intercept, resulting in a 0% False Positive rate and a low True Positive rate. As the threshold decreases, the True Positive rate will increase but so will the False Positive rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect classification occurs if the distribution of anomalous disks and normal disks are completely separated. This would yield a point in the upper left corner of the ROC space, where the False Positive rate is 0% and the True Positive rate is 100%. \n",

    "Now that you've worked your through the entire notebook, feel free to go back and adjust the models to see if you can improve accuracy.  You can add layers, increase filters, and change hyperparameters.  This is where the real art of Deep Learning happens...\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to take a systematic approach to hyperparameter optimization by sweeping the space of all parameter values and finding those which maximize some metric you're interested in.  We can then define a function to construct our model based on a given set of parameters, as well as define a scoring function which creates and trains the model and evaluates it's performance. There are many approaches to perform hyperparameter optimization using Deep Learning models. We will explore one concept called Bayesian Optimization which is a fairly common approach for this type of optimization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll continue with the LSTM model designed previously and set up the parameter search space to include adjusting the dropout rate and LSTM width along with a factor describing how much of the suggested threshold to use when classifying a defective disk.  In more complicated models, other hyperparameters such as the number of stacked LSTM layers or convolution kernel width could be included in the search space.  Just keep in mind that each new parameter will expand the search space and require more time to maximize.\n",

    "In this course, we tackled the predictive maintenance problem using different approaches. Mainly, we used a machine-learning-based approach called XGBoost to classify the defective hard drive samples. Next, we used recurrent neural networks to predict hard drive feature sequences and indicate whether the timeseries ends in a fail state or not. Finally, we used an anomaly detection approach to classify samples into defective/normal bins.\n",
    "One important factor affecting the outcome of all the models experimented in this course, is the number of data sequences. While we had the liberty of choosing among a dataset of 6M samples, the defective hard drives were significantly less. This challenge affected the outcome of the models discussed so far. To overcome similar issues in industrial applications, the reader is encouraged to investigate data augmentation techniques to increase the training set."
